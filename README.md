# Speakers notes for Haskell eXchange 2019 hands on tutorial

I ran this tutorial at haskell exchange, and people followed along on their laptops.

I separated out each step of the tutorial into numbered steps, one per commit.

You can see that list of commits here: https://github.com/benclifford/hx2019/commits/master

Start at commit number 1 (at the bottom) and work upwards, if you wish to recreate
the experience yourself. There are notes in each commit message (although they're quite
rough as they're really aimed at me, not you).

Feel free to open issues in this repo if you have questions or comments.
